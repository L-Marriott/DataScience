## Great Western Trail

GWT is the primary game in this project, as it features a scoring log, though more may be included in future. 
The game is a splatter-board of scoring conditions, meaning it can be impossible to know who is in the lead as the game progresses and which methods are optimal.
By observing the results over a large series of games, optimal methods can be compared, and even seen to evolve as players experience more games.

A breakdown of the scoring conditions may appear here later.
