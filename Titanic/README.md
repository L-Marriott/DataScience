#### Kagle Titanic Competition:

Achieved 31801 / 73574 (top 45%) with simple machine learning methods (Randomised search with gridsearchCV) after some basic feature engineering. 
Instead of further improvement here, I opted to move onto competitions that require more feature processing, such as house prices.

Further improvement would primarily be in the engineering going into a model, including better replacement of missing values, using relations between ticket class, age etc.
